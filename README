Selena - Yet another Selenium Java Framework

Selena is a fork of Skarslo's ( http://twitter.com/Skarlso) original WebAuthFW ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/webauthfw/ ).
The project aims to collect a set of tools and a set of processes that helps automating end-to-end tests via borwsers.

Requirements:
*   JDK (>=1.6)
*   ANT (>=1.8)

Uasge
*   Clone Selena
*   Create a new directory for the test code.
*   Change to that directory.
*   Copy <SelenaDir>/skeleton/build.xml to your project's root
*   Set selena.dir property to point to the directory where you've cloned Selena
*   Issue: ant initProject
*   You can try to issue an ant command, but the build will fail saying there were no tests.
